Introduction {#intro}
============

Authors of security-critical applications want the web's low-friction install process, its
linkability, and its cross-platform nature, but are understandably nervous about hosting very
powerful applications on the web alongside malicious content that can attack in any number of ways.
Chrome Apps used to be an attractive choice for building security-critical applications, since
Chrome Apps are cross-platform (across any desktop platform) and a somewhat lower-friction install
process than a native app, while offering a greater degree of isolation than a normal web app gets.
(For example, the browser prevents regular web content from initiating a navigation to a Chrome App
URL.) However, Chrome Apps are being deprecated in favor of the open web, and, indeed, it would be
nice for security-critical applications to be able to run in any browser with the degree of
isolation that they desire.

This document proposes an "Isolate-Me" concept, in which an origin can request to be isolated from
other web content. This concept targets authors of security-critical web applications who want to
give up some of the features of being on the open web (such as full linkability) in exchange for
better protection from malicious content.

Threat Model {#threat}
============

We consider a security-critical application (`very-important-bank.com`) which wants to isolate
itself from regular web content like `evil.com`. We assume that `very-important-bank.com` is a
large, complicated site with many developers, some of whom occasionally make mistakes, such as
accidentally opening up a reflected XSS vulnerability. We also assume that the user does not know
that `evil.com` is evil, and also that the user is not necessarily a power user; thus the user
does not take precautions such as using `evil.com` and `very-important-bank.com` in separate
profiles. In our threat model, `evil.com` might try to attack `very-important-bank.com` in any of
the following ways:

1.  `evil.com` might cause the user’s browser to send a request to `very-important-bank.com` that
    exploits an XSS or CSRF vulnerability (e.g. by initiating a navigation).

2.  `very-important-bank.com` might open a link to `evil.com` (because, for example, a content
    writer posted a link to `evil.com` without knowing that it was evil). This allows `evil.com`
    to obtain a reference to the `very-important-bank.com` window via window.opener, from which it
    could, for example, abuse a vulnerable {{Window/postMessage()}} API. Similarly, `evil.com`
    could open a window to `very-important-bank.com` to obtain a reference to its window.

3.  `evil.com` might exploit a vulnerability in the browser itself (UXSS) to gain access to
    `very-important-bank.com` data and cookies. While we don’t aim to give hard guarantees about
    protection from UXSS, we hope to mitigate some of the risks on a best-effort basis.

4.  `evil.com` and `very-important-bank.com` might in fact be `evil.example.com` and
    `very-important-bank.example.com`. `evil.example.com` might try to set a cookie for all of
    `example.com` in hopes that it can fix a session or CSRF token for the user on
    `very-important-bank.example.com`.

5.  `evil.com` might be able to extract data from `very-important-bank.com` by loading its resources
    or framing its content. Extraction techniques could range from exploitation of overly-broad CORS
    headers, to timing attacks like [[HEIST]], [[PIXEL-PERFECT]], etc.

6.  `evil.com` might be able to extract data from `very-important-bank.com`'s cross-site
    dependencies (say investments-r-us.biz) when they require client-side authentication to access
    data.

Communication Mechanisms {#communication}
========================

Below are some of the ways that the browser can limit cross-origin communication. An isolated origin
might want to opt into some or all of these protections. Initially we will target apps that want to
opt into all of these protections.

1.  Navigation limitations. Similar to Entry Point Regulation [[EPR]], other origins should not be
    allowed to initiate navigations to arbitrary endpoints on isolated origins. This prevents a
    malicious website from exploiting an XSS or CSRF attack by triggering a navigation to the victim
    app.

2.  <a attribute lt="opener">`window.opener`</a>. Isolated app origins should be able to disown
    windows that they open or are opened by, so that other origins are not able to obtain references
    to {{Window}} objects that are associated with isolated app origins. This prevents malicious
    websites from exploiting vulnerable {{Window/postMessage()}} APIs.

3.  Process isolation. Isolated origins should run in their own processes, when possible. This
    prevents malicious websites from exploiting browser bugs (UXSS, renderer remote code execution
    without a sandbox escape) to attack isolated origins. The threat model that process isolation
    addresses is described in more detail in the threat model section of Chromium's Site Isolation
    project page [[SITE-ISOLATION]]. Note that process isolation does not protect against, for
    example, renderer RCE with a sandbox escape, and that process isolation is a best-effort attempt
    made by the browser, not a guarantee that user agents provide.

4.  Origin-scoped cookies. If `foo.example.com` is an isolated origin, then `example.com`
    shouldn’t be able to set cookies for it. That is, `.example.com` cookies should not be sent
    along with requests to `foo.example.com`.

5.  Double-keyed storage. When an isolated origin makes a request to a third-party origin
    third-party.com, that request should use a separate cookie jar from when any other origin makes
    a request to third-party.com. Similarly, if an isolated origin embeds `third-party.com` in an
    <{iframe}>, the frame should use a separate cookie jar and separate storage (such as
    {{localStorage}}) from when `third-party.com` is loaded in any other context.

Isolation Policy {#isolation}
================

We envision that an app could isolate itself by setting an Origin Policy. Initially, the
`Isolate-Me` policy would instruct the browser to isolate the origin completely. In later versions,
the origin could potentially toggle different switches on and off to instruct the browser to isolate
it in some ways but not others. A proposed set of features constituting an isolated origin is:

1.  Force all cookies to be `SameSite`.

2.  Do not allow the isolated origin to be framed by cross-origin content.

3.  When the isolated origin frames cross-origin content, do not give the cross-origin content a
    handle to the isolated origin’s window.

4.  Double-key storage for third-party requests that the isolated origin requests. In particular,
    use a separate cookie jar when on an isolated origin, and provide separate DOM storage for
    cross-origin content that the isolated origin embeds.

5.  Do not allow any navigations from web content to the isolated origin, or only allow navigations
    from web content to the root URL on the isolated origin. (See “Open questions” below.)

6.  When the isolated origin opens a new window, disown/neueter the opened page’s window.opener.

7.  When an origin opens an isolated origin in another window, disown/neuter that origin’s
    references to the isolated origin’s window.

8.  When sending `Cookie` headers to the isolated origin, do not send cookies that were not set by
    the origin itself, and, similarly, do not include them in `document.cookie`.

While there is no explicit switch for process isolation, the user agent should run any isolated
origin in its own separate process whenever possible. This is not a firm guarantee (especially since
not all browsers implement per-site process isolation at all), but rather a best-effort attempt to
mitigate the risks of UXSS bugs.

The user agent should segregate cookie storage, localStorage, socket pools, permission storage, and
other local state by Isolate-Me policy, such that when an origin sets an Isolate-Me policy, it gets
a different cookie jar, etc. The isolated version of `foo.com` should not be contaminated by the
previously un-isolated version of `foo.com`.

Open Questions {#questions}
==============

There are many open questions, but here are a few of the biggest:

1.  How should navigations be limited? Limiting navigations breaks linkability and hinders
    functionality, but improves defense against reflected XSS and CSRF. Striking the right balance
    here will be tricky. We could only allow navigations to the root URL on the isolated origin, or
    we could transform navigations into a navigation to the root URL with some sort of message to
    allow the site to decide whether the navigation should go through. Or foreign fetch could be
    modified to allow the isolated origin’s Service Worker to intercept the navigation and decide
    whether it should be allowed. [[FOREIGN-FETCH]]

2.  Federated authentication is hard in this model. For applications that accept username/password
    authentication, things work just fine: the user navigates to `example.com` as an isolated
    origin, submits a form POST from `example.com/` to `example.com/login`, an origin-scoped cookie
    is set, and they're good to go. It's much less clear how we can reasonably support
    `isolate.example.com` authenticating via a top-level navigation to `accounts.example.com` (or
    `speakerdeck.com` via a top-level navigation to `github.com`), as the user will be moving in and
    out of the isolate's context.

    If OAuth flows are out of scope, then I'm worried that we'll end up narrowing the target
    audience too far for this to be a useful concept.

Related Work {#related}
============

Containers and Profiles {#containers}
-----------------------

The Isolate-Me concept is closely related to Firefox Containers and Chrome
profiles, which allow the user to isolate sites from each other. For example, if the user always
accesses `evil.com` in a Dangerous container/profile and `very-important-bank.com` in a Banking
container/profile, then `evil.com` is not able to effectively exploit an XSS vulnerability in
`very-important-bank.com` by navigating to a vulnerable URL; the vulnerable URL would open in
the Dangerous container/profile and would not contain any of the user’s data or cookies from the
Banking container/profile. The Isolate-Me concept gives a similar benefit, but by letting the
site author choose to isolate the site rather than letting the user choose. Isolate-Me is also
explicitly on the basis of origin; containers and profiles do not isolate origins from each
other within the same container.

Firefox containers and Chrome profiles have other benefits that are out of scope for the
Isolate-Me concept. For example, a user may want to have different Home/Work containers and stay
logged in as a different Google account in each; the Isolate-Me concept is orthogonal to this
use case. Similarly, a user may want to do all their online shopping in a Shopping container so
that the ads that they get in their Work browsing do not reflect their personal shopping habits.
This use case is also out of scope for Isolate-Me.

Site Isolation {#site-isolation}
--------------

Chrome has a large project underway to isolate each site in its own process.
Much of the site isolation infrastructure is a prerequisite for implementing Isolate-Me. For
example, if `foo.com` is an isolated origin and chooses to embed `bar.com` in a frame, `bar.com`
should run in a separate process. One of the challenges for site isolation is that it would be
far too resource-intensive to actually give every site its own process, so it would be useful
for the browser to have signals, like Isolate-Me, for which sites really should be isolated in
their own processes and which can share. (However, we should take care not to make Isolate-Me
too attractive, for fear that all sites will turn it on whether or not they need it.)
