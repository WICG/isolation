Introduction {#intro}
============

Authors of security-critical applications want the web's low-friction install process, its
linkability, and its cross-platform nature, but are understandably nervous about hosting very
powerful applications on the web alongside malicious content that can attack in any number of ways.
For example, malicious content can:

- Exploit cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities to steal
  sensitive user data or take actions on a user's behalf.

- Trick the user into revealing data or taking actions via clickjacking attacks.

- Navigate a security-critical application to a phishing page without the user's knowledge, and then
  trick the user into leaking sensitive data.

ISSUE: It may not make sense to describe Isolation as mitigating phishing scenarios like this.  It
may indeed do so, but it's not the primary goal.

- Leverage a browser vulnerability to gain access to data from other origins (universal XSS or
  UXSS).

Security-critical applications should be able to run in a browser with a degree of isolation that
mitigates these attacks. This specification defines an isolation mechanism that an origin can opt in
to, thereby reducing its exposure to other web content. Developers responsible for security-critical
web applications can choose to trade away some of the features of being on the open web (such as
full linkability) in exchange for better protection from malicious web content.

ISSUE: Given that a navigation manager enables linkability, it may not make sense to suggest there
is a necessary tradeoff, at least in this respect.

Threat Model {#threat}
------------

We consider a security-critical application, `very-important.com`, whose developers want to isolate
it from regular web content like `evil.com`. We assume that `very-important.com` is a large,
complicated site with many developers, some of whom occasionally make mistakes, such as accidentally
opening up a reflected XSS vulnerability. We also assume that the user does not know that `evil.com`
is evil, and also that the user is not necessarily a power user; thus the user does not necessarily
take precautions such as using `evil.com` and `very-important.com` in separate profiles or
browsers. In our threat model, `evil.com` might try to attack `very-important.com` in a number of
ways which this document aims to address:

1.  `evil.com` might cause the user's browser to send a request to `very-important.com` that
    exploits a cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. Such
    vulnerabilities might be triggered by navigational requests (via <{iframe}> or
    {{Window/open()}}), or by subresource requests (via <{img}>, etc).

2.  `very-important.com` might open a link to `evil.com` (for example, user-generated content could
    include an auto-linked reference to that origin, or a content write posted a link to `evil.com`
    without knowing that it is evil). This allows `evil.com` to obtain a reference to the
    `very-important.com` window via the <a attribute lt="opener">`window.opener`</a> attribute,
    which opens up communication channels ({{Window/postMessage()}}, frame counting and traversal,
    navigation of the `very-important.com` window, etc.) that `very-important.com` might not be
    expecting.

3.  Likewise, `evil.com` can obtain such a reference via {{Window/open()}}.

4.  `evil.com` might exploit a vulnerability in the browser itself (UXSS) to gain access to
    `very-important.com` data and cookies.

    Note: The mechanism proposed in this document does not aim to give hard guarantees about
    protection from UXSS, but does hope to mitigate some of the risks on a best-effort basis.

5.  `evil.com` might be able to extract data from `very-important.com` by loading its resources
    or framing its content. Extraction techniques could range from exploitation of overly-broad CORS
    headers, to timing attacks like [[HEIST]], [[PIXEL-PERFECT]], etc.

ISSUE: Maybe mention that this would be facilited by ambient authority?

6.  `very-important.com` might embed resources from other origins (e.g., `investments-r-us.biz`),
    where the user becomes authenticated with `investments-r-us.biz` by authenticating with
    `very-important.com`. `evil.com` might then be able to extract `very-important.com` user data
    from `investments-r-us.biz`, even if it can't attack `very-important.com` directly.

7.  `evil.com` and `very-important.com` might in fact be `evil.example.com` and
    `very-important.example.com`, in which case:

    1.  `evil.example.com` might try to set a cookie for all of `example.com` in hopes that it can
        fix a session or CSRF token for the user on `very-important.example.com`.

    2.  `evil.example.com` might take advantage of `very-important.example.com`'s (ill-advised)
        loosening of the same-origin policy via {{Document}}'s {{Document/domain}} attribute.

Mitigation Strategy {#strategy}
-------------------

To address the threats above, this document details an origin-wide isolation mechanism that aims to
break the communication channels between `very-important.com` and `evil.com`. When
`very-important.com` opts-in to this mechanism, the user agent will enforce the following:

1.  Resources from `very-important.com` may not be framed by cross-origin contexts. That is, the
    user agent will act as though `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'` is delivered
    with each resource. This prevents `evil.com` from exploiting attacks that require control over
    `very-important.com`'s browsing context ([[PIXEL-PERFECT]], as well as straightforward
    clickjacking), or access to `very-important.com`'s {{Window}} (via
    {{HTMLIFrameElement/contentWindow}}).

2.  Cross-origin resources framed by `very-important.com` are not given access to `window.top` or
    `window.parent` (those accessors will return `null`). This prevents `evil.com` from exploiting
    attacks which require access to `very-important.com`'s {{Window}}, or navigating the user to an
    unexpected URL to replace `very-important.com` in the top-level browsing context.

3.  When `very-important.com` opens a new, cross-origin window (via {{Window/open()}},
    `<a target="_blank">...</a>`, etc.), the new window will <a>disown its opener</a>, and the
    call to {{Window/open()}} will return `null`. That is, the user agent will act as though
    <a>noopener</a> is specified on outgoing links and {{Window/open()}} calls.

    Likewise, when `very-important.com` is opened from a cross-origin window, it will <a>disown its
    opener</a>, and the return value of {{Window/open()}} in the opener context will be `null`.

4.  All cookies set by `very-important.com` will be forced to be strict <a>same-site
    cookies</a>. This prevents `evil.com` from initiating authenticated requests to
    `very-important.com`. Further, all cookies set on `very-important.com` (including cookies set by
    responses to cross-origin requests) will be double-keyed and not sent on requests that occur
    outside the isolated context. This prevents `evil.com` from attacking ambient authority granted
    to `very-important.com`'s cross-site dependencies by virtue of being embedded in
    `very-important.com`.

5.  Navigation into the isolated origin will be regulated by a <a>navigation manager</a>.  Code from
    the isolated origin will get to validate each navigation before allowing it to proceed.

6.  The user agent should load `example.com` into a separate process from other web content.

    Note: This is not a firm guarantee (especially since not all browsers implement per-site process
    isolation at all), but rather a best-effort attempt to mitigate the risks of UXSS bugs.


Key Concepts {#concepts}
============

An <dfn>isolated origin</dfn> is an <a for="/">origin</a> that has opted in to isolate itself from
other origins on the web, using the mechanisms defined in this specification.

User agents have an <dfn>isolated origin store</dfn>, which is a list of
<a lt="isolated origin">isolated origins</a>.

When asked if an <dfn>origin is isolated</dfn>, an <a>isolated origin store</a> will return true if
the given origin appears in its list, and false otherwise.

ISSUE: Expand to have an expiration time for each isolated origin in the store.

Opting into isolation {#delivery}
============

<a>Isolated origins</a> are defined by an <dfn>isolation</dfn> HTTP response header. The syntax for
the name and value of the header are described by the following ABNF grammar [[!RFC5234]]:

<pre dfn-type="grammar">
    "Isolation:" *<a>WSP</a> "1" *<a>WSP</a>
</pre>

ISSUE: Add a max-age

[[#fetch-header]] describes how the <a>isolation</a> header is processed.

ISSUE: the isolate-me HTTP header needs to be sent and/or processed before the Set-Cookie header...

Controlling navigations {#navigation}
============

An <a>isolated origin</a> can use a <a>service worker</a> to perform security checks on
navigations. By default, every navigation to an isolated origin fails, unless the origin has a
<a>service worker</a> which explicitly allows it.

[[#fetch-navigation-checks]] and [[#process-a-navigate-response]] describe how the Fetch and HTML
specs are modified to fail navigations to an <a>isolated origin</a> unless a <a>service worker</a>
has performed security checks on them.

Integrations {#integrations}
============

Integration with HTML {#html}
------------

### Origin ### {#html-origin}

The HTML concept of <a for="/">origin</a> should be expanded to contain a boolean
<dfn>isolated</dfn> getter. This getter returns true if the <a>origin is isolated</a> and false
otherwise.

The <a>same origin</a> check should be modified to return false if `A` is <a lt="origin is
isolated">isolated</a> but `B` is not, or vice versa.

ISSUE: Justify why the isolated flag does not need to be serialized

### Cross-origin framing of isolated origins ### {#cross-origin-framing}

Isolated origins should not be framed by cross-origin content. Step 1 of <a>Process a navigate
response</a> should be modified to call [[#should-block-navigation-response]].

### Disowning isolated openers ### {#disown-opener}

When an isolated origin opens a new window to a different origin, that origin should not be able to
manipulate the isolated origin via the `window.opener` attribute.

<a>Initializing a new Document object</a> should be modified to call [[#disown-isolated-opener]] on
|browsingContext| and the <a>response</a> used to generate the document.

### Removing cross-origin subframe references ### {#remove-cross-origin-subframe-references}

When an isolated origin embeds cross-origin subframes, those subframes should not be able to obtain
references to the isolated origin's window via `window.top` or `window.parent`.

The <a attribute lt="top" for="/">`window.top`</a> attribute algorithm should be modified to return
null if `context`'s <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>'s
<a for="Document">origin</a> is an <a>isolated origin</a>.

Similarly, the <a attribute lt="parent" for="/">`window.parent`</a> attribute algorithm should be
modified to return null if `context`'s <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>'s
<a for="Document">origin</a> is an <a>isolated origin</a>.

### Process a navigate response ### {#process-a-navigate-response}

<a>Process a navigate response</a> should be modified to fail a navigation to an <a>isolated
origin</a> if it has not been explicitly allowed by a <a>service worker</a> for that
origin. Specifically, Step 1 should be modified to include the condition:
  - |response|'s <a for="url">url</a>'s <a for="url">origin</a> is an <a>isolated origin</a> and
    |request|'s <a>allow isolated navigation</a> flag is unset.

Integration with Cookies {#cookies}
------------

This section defines modifications to [[!COOKIES]] to support isolated origins.

### Forcing cookies to be same-site ### {#forcing-cookies-samesite}

Forcing cookies from isolated origins to be same-site means that an attacker cannot initiate an
authenticated request from a victim's browser to an isolated origin.

When receiving a cookie string on a request whose initiator's <a for="Document">origin</a> is
<a>isolated</a>, if the request's <a for="Request">origin</a> is <a>same origin</a> with the
initiator's <a for="Document">origin</a>, Section 5.3 should be modified to set the cookie's
`samesite-flag` field to "Strict".

### Double-keyed storage ### {#double-keyed-cookies}

When a cookie is set on a request for which the top-level document is an <a>isolated origin</a>, the
cookie should be double-keyed, such that the cookie is only sent on requests initiated by contexts
in which the top-level document is the same <a>isolated origin</a>. This prevents attackers from
attacking ambient authority that an isolated origin's cross-site dependencies obtain by virtue of
being embedded in the isolated origin.

This section defines modifications to [[!COOKIES]] to support these double-keyed cookies.

#### Storage model #### {#cookies-storage-model}

The storage model of [[!COOKIES]] should be updated to keep track of when cookies are set in a
top-level isolated origin as follows. Section 5.3 of [[!COOKIES]] should be modified to store an
additional `isolated-origin` field for each cookie. When processing a cookie, if the <a>request</a>
has a non-null <a>client</a>, then let `top origin` be the <a for="Document">origin</a> of
the <a>request</a>'s <a>client</a>'s
<a>responsible browsing context</a>'s <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>active Document</a>. If
`top origin` is an <a>isolated origin</a>, then then the user agent should set the `isolated-origin`
cookie field to `top origin`. Otherwise, the user agent should set the `isolated-origin` cookie
field to the empty string.

ISSUE: define this section for Worker-based requests

#### The Cookie header #### {#cookie-header}

[[!COOKIES]] should be updated to ensure that cookies that were set on an isolated origin are not
sent in other contexts outside that origin. In other words, Section 5.4 of [[!COOKIES]] should be
modified to add the following to the list of requirements in step 1:

- If the cookie's `isolated-origin` field is not the empty string, then the <a>request</a> must have
  a non-null <a>client</a> whose <a>responsible browsing context</a>'s <a>top-level browsing
  context</a>'s <a>active Document</a>'s <a for="Document">origin</a> is an <a>isolated origin</a> and
  is <a>same origin</a> with the cookie's `isolated-origin` field.

ISSUE: these cookie changes don't prevent all session fixation attacks. If a user has never visited
victim.example.com before, evil.example.com can set a cookie for .example.com, which will be sent on
the request when the user first navigates to victim.example.com. The isolated origin can mitigate
this by using __Host- cookies for sensitive cookies. Maybe isolated origins should be required to
use __Host- on all cookies.

## Integration with Fetch ## {#fetch}

### Navigation checks ### {#fetch-navigation-checks}

The Fetch spec should be modified to give <a>request</a> a boolean
<dfn>allow isolated navigation</dfn> flag, which is false by default. This flag is checked on
navigations to isolated origins in [[#process-a-navigate-response]].

The <a>Request</a> class should be modified to have an <dfn method
for="Request"><code>allowIsolatedNavigation()</code></dfn> method, which, when invoked, must run
these steps:

1. Let |origin| be <a>current settings object</a>'s <a for="environment">origin</a>.

2. If |origin| is not <a>same origin</a> with |request|'s <a for="request">current url</a>'s <a
   for="url">origin</a>, then abort these steps.

   ISSUE: should this throw an exception instead?

3. Set |request|'s <a>allow isolated navigation</a> flag to true.

NOTE: A service worker or a consumer of the Fetch API must call <a>allowIsolatedNavigation()</a> on
a <a>Request</a> in order for a navigation to an isolated origin to be allowed.

ISSUE: Does this allow for navigation requests to redirect to isolated origins? Do we want it to?

### Processing <a>isolation</a> headers ### {#fetch-header}

Fetch should be updated to call [[#isolate-an-origin]] on |response| after Step 13 of <a>HTTP-network fetch</a>.

Algorithms {#algorithms}
============

<h3 id="should-block-navigation-response" algorithm>
    Should |navigation response| in |target| be blocked?
</h3>

This algorithm is used to block cross-origin framing of isolated origins. Given a <a>response</a>
(|navigation response|) and a <a>browsing context</a> (|target|), this algorithm returns "`Blocked`"
if |navigation response| is from an isolated origin and one or more of the ancestors of |target| is
cross-origin.

1. If |target| is not a <a>nested browsing context</a>, return "`Allowed`".

2. If |navigation response|'s <a for="response">url</a>'s <a for="url">origin</a> is not an
   <a>isolated origin</a>, then return "`Allowed`".

3. Let |current| be |target|.

4. Let |navigation origin| be a copy of |navigation response|'s <a for="response">url</a>'s <a
   for="/">origin</a>. Set |navigation origin|'s <a>isolated</a> flag to true.

4.  While |current| has a <a>parent browsing context</a> (|parent|):
  1. Set |current| to |parent|.
  2. Let |origin| be |current|'s <a>active document</a>'s <a>relevant settings object</a>'s <a
     for="environment settings object">origin</a>.
  3. If |origin| is not <a>same origin</a> with |navigation origin|, return "`Blocked`".

6. Return "`Allowed`".

<h3 id="disown-isolated-opener" algorithm>
    Disown an isolated opener
</h3>

Given a <a>browsing context</a> (|browsingContext|) and a <a>response</a> (|response|) used to
generate a <a>document</a>, this algorithm disowns |browsingContext|'s opener if the opener is an
isolated origin.

1. If |browsingContext| does not have an <a>opener browsing context</a>, then abort these steps.

2. Let |openedOrigin| be a copy of |response|'s <a for="response">url</a>'s {{URL/origin}}.

3. Let |openerOrigin| be |browsingContext|'s <a>opener browsing context</a>'s <a>active
   document</a>'s <a>relevant settings object</a>'s <a for="environment settings object">origin</a>.

4. If |openerOrigin| is not an <a>isolated origin</a>, abort these steps.

5. If |openedOrigin| is <a>same origin</a> with |openerOrigin|, then abort these steps.

6. |browsingContext| should <a>disown its opener</a>.

<h3 id="isolate-an-origin" algorithm>
    Isolate an origin
</h3>

This algorithm is called from <a>HTTP-network fetch</a> to process an <a>isolation</a> header on a
<a>response</a> |response|.

1. If <a>extracting header list values</a> given <a>isolation</a> and |response|'s <a>header
   list</a> returns null, then abort these steps.

2. Let |origin| be |response|'s <a for="response">url</a>'s <a for="url">origin</a>.

3. If |origin| is not an <a>isolated origin</a>, set |request|'s <a>allow isolated navigation</a>
   flag to true.

NOTE: This step ensures that the first navigation to an isolated origin is allowed.

4. Add |origin| to the user agent's <a>isolated origin store</a>.
