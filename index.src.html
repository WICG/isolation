Introduction {#intro}
============

Authors of security-critical applications want the web's low-friction install process, its
linkability, and its cross-platform nature, but are understandably nervous about hosting very
powerful applications on the web alongside malicious content that can attack in any number of ways.
For example, malicious content can:

- Exploit cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities to steal
  sensitive user data or take actions on a user's behalf.

- Trick the user into revealing data or taking actions via clickjacking attacks.

- Navigate a security-critical application to a phishing page without the user's knowledge, and then
  trick the user into leaking sensitive data.

- Leverage a browser vulnerability to gain access to data from other origins (universal XSS or
  UXSS).

Security-critical applications should be able to run in a browser with a degree of isolation that
mitigates these attacks. This specification defines an isolation mechanism that an origin can opt in
to, thereby reducing its exposure to other web content. Developers responsible for security-critical
web applications can choose to trade away some of the features of being on the open web (such as
full linkability) in exchange for better protection from malicious web content.

Threat Model {#threat}
------------

We consider a security-critical application, `very-important.com`, whose developers want to isolate
it from regular web content like `evil.com`. We assume that `very-important.com` is a large,
complicated site with many developers, some of whom occasionally make mistakes, such as accidentally
opening up a reflected XSS vulnerability. We also assume that the user does not know that `evil.com`
is evil, and also that the user is not necessarily a power user; thus the user does not necessarily
take precautions such as using `evil.com` and `very-important.com` in separate profiles or
browsers. In our threat model, `evil.com` might try to attack `very-important.com` in a number of
ways which this document aims to address:

1.  `evil.com` might cause the user's browser to send a request to `very-important.com` that
    exploits a cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. Such
    vulnerabilities might be triggered by navigational requests (via <{iframe}> or
    {{Window/open()}}), or by subresource requests (via <{img}>, etc).

2.  `very-important.com` might open a link to `evil.com` (for example, user-generated content could
    include an auto-linked reference to that origin, or a content write posted a link to `evil.com`
    without knowing that it is evil). This allows `evil.com` to obtain a reference to the
    `very-important.com` window via the <a attribute lt="opener">`window.opener`</a> attribute,
    which opens up communication channels ({{Window/postMessage()}}, frame counting and traversal,
    navigation of the `very-important.com` window, etc.) that `very-important.com` might not be
    expecting.

3.  Likewise, `evil.com` can obtain such a reference via {{Window/open()}}.

4.  `evil.com` might exploit a vulnerability in the browser itself (UXSS) to gain access to
    `very-important.com` data and cookies.

    Note: The mechanism proposed in this document does not aim to give hard guarantees about
    protection from UXSS, but does hope to mitigate some of the risks on a best-effort basis.

5.  `evil.com` might be able to extract data from `very-important.com` by loading its resources
    or framing its content. Extraction techniques could range from exploitation of overly-broad CORS
    headers, to timing attacks like [[HEIST]], [[PIXEL-PERFECT]], etc.

6.  `very-important.com` might embed resources from other origins (e.g., `investments-r-us.biz`),
    where the user becomes authenticated with `investments-r-us.biz` by authenticating with
    `very-important.com`. `evil.com` might then be able to extract `very-important.com` user data
    from `investments-r-us.biz`, even if it can't attack `very-important.com` directly.

7.  `evil.com` and `very-important.com` might in fact be `evil.example.com` and
    `very-important.example.com`, in which case:

    1.  `evil.example.com` might try to set a cookie for all of `example.com` in hopes that it can
        fix a session or CSRF token for the user on `very-important.example.com`.

    2.  `evil.example.com` might take advantage of `very-important.example.com`'s (ill-advised)
        loosening of the same-origin policy via {{Document}}'s {{Document/domain}} attribute.

Mitigation Strategy {#strategy}
-------------------

To address the threats above, this document details an origin-wide isolation mechanism that aims to
break the communication channels between `very-important.com` and `evil.com`. When
`very-important.com` opts-in to this mechanism, the user agent will enforce the following:

1.  Resources from `very-important.com` may not be framed by cross-origin contexts. That is, the
    user agent will act as though `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'` is delivered
    with each resource. This prevents `evil.com` from exploiting attacks that require control over
    `very-important.com`'s browsing context ([[PIXEL-PERFECT]], as well as straightforward
    clickjacking), or access to `very-important.com`'s {{Window}} (via
    {{HTMLIFrameElement/contentWindow}}).

2.  Cross-origin resources framed by `very-important.com` are not given access to `window.top` or
    `window.parent` (those accessors will return `null`). This prevents `evil.com` from exploiting
    attacks which require access to `very-important.com`'s {{Window}}, or navigating the user to an
    unexpected URL to replace `very-important.com` in the top-level browsing context.

3.  When `very-important.com` opens a new, cross-origin window (via {{Window/open()}},
    `<a target="_blank">...</a>`, etc.), the new window will <a>disown its opener</a>, and the
    call to {{Window/open()}} will return `null`. That is, the user agent will act as though
    <a>noopener</a> is specified on outgoing links and {{Window/open()}} calls.

    Likewise, when `very-important.com` is opened from a cross-origin window, it will <a>disown its
    opener</a>, and the return value of {{Window/open()}} in the opener context will be `null`.

4.  All cookies set by `very-important.com` will be forced to be <a>same-site cookies</a>. This
    prevents `evil.com` from initiating authenticated requests to `very-important.com`. Further, all
    cookies set on `very-important.com` (including cookies set by responses to cross-origin
    requests) will be double-keyed and not sent on requests that occur outside the isolated
    context. This prevents `evil.com` from attacking ambient authority granted to
    `very-important.com`'s cross-site dependencies by virtue of being embedded in
    `very-important.com`.

5.  Something something cross-origin navigation to `example.com`.

    ISSUE: Update this with David's navigation manager proposal

6.  The user agent should load `example.com` into a separate process from other web content.

    Note: This is not a firm guarantee (especially since not all browsers implement per-site process
    isolation at all), but rather a best-effort attempt to mitigate the risks of UXSS bugs.


Key Concepts {#concepts}
============

An <dfn>isolated origin</dfn> is an <a for="/">origin</a> that has opted in to isolate itself from
other origins on the web, using the mechanisms defined in this specification.

User agents have an <dfn>isolated origin store</dfn>, which is a set of <a for="/">origins</a> that
wish to be isolated.

When asked <dfn algorithm local-lt="is-origin-isolated">if an origin is isolated</dfn>, an
<a>isolated origin store</a> returns true if the given origin is present in the set and false
otherwise.

When asked to <dfn algorithm local-lt="isolate-an-origin">isolate an origin</dfn>, an <a>isolated
origin store</a> adds the given origin to the set.

When asked to <dfn algorithm local-lt="deisolate-an-origin">de-isolate an origin</dfn>, an
<a>isolated origin store</a> removes the given origin from the set.

Delivery {#delivery}
============

ISSUE: define an HTTP header that is processed in Fetch and calls isolate-an-origin or
deisolate-an-origin

ISSUE: the isolate-me HTTP header needs to be sent and/or processed before the Set-Cookie header...

Integrations {#integrations}
============

Integration with Cookies {#cookies}
------------

This section defines modifications to [[!COOKIES]] to support isolated origins.

### Forcing cookies to be same-site ### {#forcing-cookies-samesite}

When receiving a cookie from a request-uri whose origin is an <a>isolated origin</a>, Section 5.3
should be modified to set the cookie's `samesite-flag` field to "Strict" if the request-uri's <a
lt="is-origin-isolated">origin is isolated</a>.

### Double-keyed storage ### {#double-keyed-cookies}

When a cookie is set on a request for which the top-level document is an <a>isolated origin</a>, the
cookie should be double-keyed, such that the cookie is only sent on requests initiated by contexts
in which the top-level document is the same <a>isolated origin</a>. This section defines
modifications to [[!COOKIES]] to support these double-keyed cookies.

#### Storage model #### {#cookies-storage-model}

Section 5.3 of [[!COOKIES]] should be modified to store an additional `isolated-origin` field for
each cookie. When processing a cookie, if the <a>request</a> has a non-null <a>client</a>, then let
`top origin` be the <a for="Document">origin</a> of the <a>request</a>'s <a>client</a>'s
<a>responsible browsing context</a>'s <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>active Document</a>. If
`top origin` is an <a>isolated origin</a>, then then the user agent should set the `isolated-origin`
cookie field to `top origin`. Otherwise, the user agent should set the `isolated-origin` cookie
field to the empty string.

ISSUE: define this section for Worker-based requests

#### The Cookie header #### {#cookie-header}

Section 5.4 of [[!COOKIES]] should be modified to add the following to the list of requirements in
step 1:

- If the cookie's `isolated-origin` field is not the empty string, then the <a>request</a> must have
  a non-null <a>client</a> whose <a>responsible browsing context</a>'s <a>top-level browsing
  context</a>'s <a>active Document</a>'s <a for="Document">origin</a> is an <a>isolated origin</a> and
  is <a>same origin</a> with the cookie's `isolated-origin` field.

ISSUE: these cookie changes don't prevent all session fixation attacks. If a user has never visited
victim.example.com before, evil.example.com can set a cookie for .example.com, which will be sent on
the request when the user first navigates to victim.example.com. The isolated origin can mitigate
this by using __Host- cookies for sensitive cookies. Maybe isolated origins should be required to
use __Host- on all cookies.

Integration with HTML {#html}
------------

### Cross-origin framing of isolated origins ### {#cross-origin-framing}

Step 1 of <a>Process a navigate response</a> should be modified to call
[[#should-block-navigation-response]], so that cross-origin framing of isolated origins is not
allowed.

### DOM storage ### {#dom-storage}

When an origin becomes isolated, it should use its own DOM storage separate from what it used before
being isolated.

#### `localStorage` #### {#localstorage}

Instead of providing a <a>Storage</a> object for each <a for="/">origin</a>, the `localStorage`
object should provide two <a>Storage</a> objects, one for isolated origins and one for non-isolated
origins. Step 3 of
<a lt="storage object initialisation steps">the `Storage` object initialization steps</a> for
`localStorage` should be modified to read as follows:

3. Check to see if the user agent has allocated a local storage area for the `(origin, isolated)`
   pair, where `origin` is the <a for="/">origin</a> of the <a>Document</a> of the <a>Window</a>
   object on which the attribute was accessed, and `isolated` is a boolean flag that is true if the
   <a for="/">origin</a> is an <a>isolated origin</a> and false otherwise. If it has not, create a
   new storage area for that `(origin, isolated)` pair.

#### `sessionStorage` #### {#sessionstorage}

{{sessionStorage}} should be modified as follows. Each <a>top-level browsing context</a> should have
a unique set of session storage areas, one for each `(origin, isolated)` pair, where `isolated` is a
boolean flag that is true if the <a for="/">`origin`</a> is an <a>isolated origin</a> and false
otherwise.

When a new <a>Document</a> is created in a <a>browsing context</a> which has a <a>top-level browsing
context</a>, the user agent must check to see if that <a>top-level browsing context</a> has a
session storage area for the pair `(origin, isolated)`, where `origin` is the
document's <a for="/">origin</a> and `isolated` is true if `origin` is an <a>isolated origin</a> and
false otherwise. If it does, then that is the <a>Document</a>'s assigned session storage area. If it
does not, a new storage area for that document's <a for="Document">origin</a> must be created, and
then <i>that</i> is the <a>Document</a>'s assigned session storage area.

### Disowning isolated openers ### {#disown-opener}

When an isolated origin opens a new window to a different origin, that origin should not be able to
manipulate the isolated origin via the `window.opener` attribute.

<a>Initializing a new Document object</a> should be modified to call [[#disown-isolated-opener]] on
|browsingContext| and the <a>response</a> used to generate the document.

### Removing cross-origin subframe references ### {#remove-cross-origin-subframe-references}

When an isolated origin embeds cross-origin subframes, those subframes should not be able to obtain
references to the isolated origin's window via `window.top` or `window.parent`.

The <a attribute lt="top" for="/">`window.top`</a> attribute algorithm should be modified to return
null if `context`'s <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>'s
<a for="Document">origin</a> is an <a>isolated origin</a>.

Similarly, the <a attribute lt="parent" for="/">`window.parent`</a> attribute algorithm should be
modified to return null if `context`'s <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>'s
<a for="Document">origin</a> is an <a>isolated origin</a>.

Algorithms {#algorithms}
============

<h3 id="should-block-navigation-response" algorithm>
    Should |navigation response| in |target| be blocked?
</h3>

Given a <a>response</a> (|navigation response|) and a <a>browsing context</a> (|target|), this
algorithm returns "`Blocked`" if |navigation response| is from an isolated origin and one or more of
the ancestors of |target| is cross-origin.

1. If |target| is not a <a>nested browsing context</a>, return "`Allowed`".

2. Let |navigation origin| be the result of executing the <a>URL parser</a> on the <a lt="unicode
   serialization of an origin">unicode serialization</a> of |navigation response|'s <a
   for="response">url</a>'s {{URL/origin}}.

3. If |navigation origin| is not <a lt="is-origin-isolated">an isolated origin</a>, return
  "`Allowed`".

4. Let |current| be |target|.

5. While |current| has a <a>parent browsing context</a> (|parent|):
  1. Set |current| to |parent|.
  2. Let |origin| be the result of executing the <a>URL parser</a> on the <a lt="unicode
     serialization of an origin">unicode serialization</a> of |parent|'s <a>active document</a>'s
     <a>relevant settings object</a>'s <a for="environment settings object">origin</a>.
  3. If |origin| is not <a>same origin</a> with |navigation origin|, return "`Blocked`".

6. Return "`Allowed`".

<h3 id="disown-isolated-opener" algorithm>
    Disown an isolated opener
</h3>

Given a <a>browsing context</a> (|browsingContext|) and a <a>response</a> (|response|) used to
generate a <a>document</a>, this algorithm disowns |browsingContext|'s opener if the opener is an
isolated origin.

1. If |browsingContext| does not have an <a>opener browsing context</a>, then abort these steps.

2. Let |openedOrigin| be the result of executing the <a>URL parser</a> on the <a lt="unicode
   serialization of an origin">unicode serialization</a> of |response|'s <a for="response">url</a>'s
   {{URL/origin}}.

3. Let |openerOrigin| be the result of executing the <a>URL parser</a> on the <a lt="unicode
   serialization of an origin">unicode serialization</a> of |browsingContext|'s <a>opener browsing
   context</a>'s <a>active document</a>'s <a>relevant settings object</a>'s
   <a for="environment settings object">origin</a>.

4. If |openedOrigin| is <a>same origin</a> with |openerOrigin|, then abort these steps.

5. If |openerOrigin| <a lt="is-origin-isolated">is an isolated origin</a>, then |browsingContext|
   should <a>disown its opener</a>.
